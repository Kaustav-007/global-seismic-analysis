🌎 Earthquake Data Analysis (1965–2016)

This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global earthquake events spanning over five decades, using Python and scientific computing libraries. The goal was to understand seismic patterns, magnitude distributions, temporal trends, and geographic characteristics of earthquakes across the world.
